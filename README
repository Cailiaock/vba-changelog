The inspiration and starter code for this code was provided by:
        
http://www.ozgrid.com/VBA/track-changes.htm

The code on their page will provide you with a change log recording
the following fields:
        1) CELL CHANGED
        2) OLD VALUE
        3) NEW VALUE 
        4) TIME OF CHANGE
        5) DATE OF CHANGE

My code will track the following fields:
        1) SHEET
        1) CELL
        2) OLD VALUE
        3) NEW VALUE 
        4) TIME
        5) DATE
        6) USER

The other main difference between the two is my version will also 
track changes to multiple cells at one time. There is one fairly major
limitation to the code though. If you select a number of cells larger
than the defined limit of an array you will crash the buffer.

To use simply place the code in the Private Module of the Workbook (ThisWorkbook).

Pull requests are welcome as always.
