# VBA ChangeLog

## Credit
The inspiration and starter code for this code was provided by:
    http://www.ozgrid.com/VBA/track-changes.htm

## How mine differs
The code on their page will provide you with a change log recording
the following fields:

 *  Cell Changed
 *  Old Value
 *  New Value
 *  Time of Change
 *  Date of Change

My code will track the following fields:

 * Sheet
 * Cell
 * Old Value
 * New Value
 * Time
 * Date
 * User

The other main difference between the two is my version will also
track changes to **multiple cells** at one time.

## Final notes
Please keep in mind I've posted this code here in hopes that its helpful to someone else
who also needs similar functionality out of Excel. Given that, there is some stuff in here
that is very specific to me. If you run across hardcoded strings that make no sense... then
change them.
